Resources used: Assignment specifications, module resources CS23820 and additional web-resources marked in the code
Based of module lecturer Neal Snook's design
*****************************************************************************************

To build include the following files:

main.c
transformList.c
branchList.c
callStackList.c

*****************************************************************************************
This application is the final project for the module CS23820, "Programming in C/C++".

The program itself reads a custom file format at a user specified location, and
outputs a browser readable ".svg" file with the same file name as the input.

The accepted file format consists of the following generic example lines
A Transform line (numbers are variable), a Graphic Line and Fractal elements with branches

*****************************************************************************************
TRANSFORM name_in_lowercase ROTATION 0 TRANSLATION (0,0) SCALE 1.0

GRAPHIC name_in_lowercase (0,25) (105,105) (25,0)

FRACTAL f1
BRANCH reference_to_Transform_Item [0:8] GRAPHIC reference_to_graphic
BRANCH reference_to_Transform_Item [0:30] GRAPHIC reference_to_graphic

*****************************************************************************************

WARNING: If your specification file does not load you may have the following issue:
- A space in the "TRANSLATION (n, n)", change to "TRANSLATION (n,n)"

Most other issues should get flagged by the program
